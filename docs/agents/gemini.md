## Modes

- **Drive mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` - Creates branch only, work in current directory
- **Fleet mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID> <agents...>` - Creates worktrees for parallel implementation

## Mandatory Lifecycle Commands

Feature and research work are NOT complete until you run these commands yourself:

1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — when you start coding or begin active research
2. `aigon agent-status submitted` — after committing all code, log updates, or research findings

These are CLI commands you run directly — not slash commands, not auto-invoked. The `aigon agent-status` command writes state to the **main repo** (not the worktree), so you won't see state files locally. Just run the command and trust the output.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the spec first**: Always resolve the active feature spec with `aigon feature-spec <ID>` before coding
2. **Work in isolation**: Drive mode uses branches, Fleet mode uses worktrees
3. **Conventional commits**: Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes
4. **Complete properly**: Use `/aigon:feature-close <ID>` for Drive, `/aigon:feature-close <ID> gg` for Fleet
5. **Follow project instructions**: Check `AGENTS.md` for shared project build, test, and dependency commands
6. **Orient to the codebase first**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before making structural CLI changes

## Drive Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` to create branch and move spec
2. Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation
3. Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`

## Fleet Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID> cc cx gg cu` to create worktrees for each agent
2. **STOP** - Tell the user to open the worktree in a separate session
3. In the worktree session:
   - Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>`
   - Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
   - Implement the feature
   - The `feature-do` command handles commit, log, and signaling completion — stay in the session for user review
4. Return to main repo for evaluation: `/aigon:feature-eval <ID>`
5. Merge winner: `/aigon:feature-close <ID> cx`
6. Clean up losers: `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID> --push` (to save branches) or `/aigon:feature-cleanup <ID>` (to delete)

## Research Workflow

Research follows the same lifecycle shape as features: `start -> do -> submit -> eval -> close`.

### Drive Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID>` to move the topic to in-progress
2. Run `/aigon:research-do <ID>` to conduct the research
3. Write findings directly in the main research document
4. Run `aigon agent-status submitted` when your research pass is complete
5. Run `/aigon:research-close <ID>` when ready to finish

### Fleet Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID> cc cx gg cu` to prepare and launch parallel research
2. In each agent session, run `/aigon:research-do <ID>`
3. Each agent writes only to its own findings file and signals completion
4. Return to the main repo for synthesis: `/aigon:research-eval <ID>`
5. Finish the topic: `/aigon:research-close <ID>`
6. Use `/aigon:research-open <ID>` only to re-open or attach Fleet research sessions after setup


## Saving Permissions

When the user says "save that permission" or "remember that":

1. Read or create a TOML file in `.gemini/policies/` (e.g., `.gemini/policies/custom.toml`)
2. Add a `[[rule]]` block with the tool name, decision, and priority
3. Example:
   ```toml
   [[rule]]
   toolName = "run_shell_command"
   commandPrefix = "npm"
   decision = "allow"
   priority = 100
   ```

Note: The old `allowedTools` array in settings.json is deprecated. Use Policy Engine TOML files instead.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `/aigon:feature-close`, always:

1. **Push the branch to origin** to save your work remotely:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch-name>
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)

## Common Pitfalls — READ THIS FIRST

These are recurring mistakes that derail Gemini sessions. Check yourself against this list before and during every task.

### 1. Working on `main` instead of a feature branch
**Symptom**: You commit code directly to `main`, polluting the shared branch.
**Prevention**: ALWAYS run `git branch --show-current` before writing any code. If it returns `main`, STOP. Run `/aigon:feature-start` or switch to the correct feature branch.
**Recovery**: If you already committed to `main`, tell the user immediately — do not try to fix it yourself.

### 2. Forgetting lifecycle commands
**Symptom**: Dashboard shows agent as idle when it's actually working, or work is never marked as done.
**Prevention**: Run these in order, every time:
1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — before you start work
2. `aigon agent-status submitted` — after your final commit
These are NOT optional. They are mandatory signals.

### 3. Modifying files you don't own (research)
**Symptom**: Research commit includes code changes or other agents' findings.
**Prevention**: In research mode, you write ONLY to `research-{ID}-gg-findings.md`. Stage only that file: `git add docs/specs/research-topics/logs/research-*-gg-findings.md`. Never use `git add .`.

### 4. Using `git add .` or `git add -A`
**Symptom**: Unrelated files (`.env.local`, other agents' work, IDE config) get committed.
**Prevention**: Always stage specific files by path. Run `git status` first to review what changed, then `git add <specific-file>`.

### 5. Running commands you weren't asked to run
**Symptom**: Running `feature-close`, `research-close`, or `feature-eval` when the user didn't ask.
**Prevention**: After submitting, STAY in the session and wait. The user decides what happens next — close, eval, or more changes.

### 6. Not reading the spec before implementing
**Symptom**: Implementation doesn't match acceptance criteria, wrong approach taken.
**Prevention**: Always resolve the active spec with `aigon feature-spec <ID>` before writing a single line of code.

### 7. Ignoring the working directory in worktree mode
**Symptom**: Editing files in the main repo instead of the worktree, or vice versa.
**Prevention**: Run `pwd` and verify you're in the correct directory. Worktree paths look like `../project-worktrees/feature-{ID}-gg-{desc}`.
