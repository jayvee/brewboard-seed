# Gemini CLI Configuration

## Agent Identity
- **Agent ID**: `gg`
- **Worktree Pattern**: `../feature-NN-gg-description`
- **Implementation Log**: Mode-conditional — Fleet requires a short log under `./docs/specs/features/logs/`; solo Drive (branch) skips it by default; solo Drive worktree uses a one-line log when a starter file exists. Override with `"logging_level": "fleet-only" | "always" | "never"` in `.aigon/config.json` (see `docs/development_workflow.md`).

## Modes

- **Drive mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` - Creates branch only, work in current directory
- **Fleet mode**: `/aigon:feature-start <ID> <agents...>` - Creates worktrees for parallel implementation

## Mandatory Lifecycle Commands

Feature and research work are NOT complete until you run these commands yourself:

1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — when you start coding or begin active research
2. `aigon agent-status implementation-complete` — after committing all code, log updates, or research findings

These are direct lifecycle commands you run yourself in the agent host — slash commands for some agents, skills for Codex, and never auto-invoked. The `aigon agent-status` command writes state to the **main repo** (not the worktree), so you won't see state files locally. Just run the command and trust the output.

## Critical Rules

1. **Read the active spec first**: Use `aigon feature-spec <ID>` for features. For research, read the spec directly from `docs/specs/research-topics/03-in-progress/`
2. **Use the correct workspace model**: Feature Drive uses a branch, Feature Fleet uses worktrees, Research usually runs in the main repo unless explicitly launched as parallel sessions
3. **Use conventional commits when you commit**: Prefer `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `docs:` as appropriate
4. **Complete with the matching command**: Use the `feature-*` or `research-*` close/review/eval command for the entity you are working on
5. **Follow project instructions**: Check `AGENTS.md` for shared project build, test, and dependency commands
6. **Orient to the codebase first**: Read `docs/architecture.md` before making structural CLI changes

## Drive Mode Workflow

1. Run `/aigon:feature-start <ID>` to create branch and move spec
2. Run `/aigon:feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation
3. Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/`
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `/aigon:feature-close <ID>`

## Research Workflow

Research follows the same lifecycle shape as features: `start -> do -> submit -> review/eval -> close`.

### Drive Mode

1. Run `/aigon:research-start <ID>` to move the topic to in-progress
2. Run `/aigon:research-do <ID>` to conduct the research
3. Write findings directly in the main research document
4. Optionally run `/aigon:research-review <ID>` for a second-agent review pass
5. Run `aigon agent-status implementation-complete` when your research pass is complete (from outside the tmux session, use the explicit form: `aigon agent-status implementation-complete <ID> <agent>`)
6. Run `/aigon:research-close <ID>` when ready to finish

## Saving Permissions

When the user says "save that permission" or "remember that":

1. Read or create a TOML file in `~/.gemini/policies/` (e.g., `~/.gemini/policies/custom.toml`)
2. Add a `[[rule]]` block with the tool name, decision, and priority
3. Example:
   ```toml
   [[rule]]
   toolName = "run_shell_command"
   commandPrefix = "npm"
   decision = "allow"
   priority = 100
   ```

Note: The old `allowedTools` array in settings.json is deprecated. Use Policy Engine TOML files instead.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `/aigon:feature-close`, always:

1. **If you want GitHub PR review, publish the branch**:
   ```bash
   /aigon:feature-push
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)

## Common Pitfalls — READ THIS FIRST

These are recurring mistakes that derail Gemini sessions. Check yourself against this list before and during every task.

### 1. Using the wrong workspace for the task
**Symptom**: You commit feature work to `main`, or you treat a research session like a feature branch task.
**Prevention**: Check both `pwd` and `git branch --show-current` before you start.
- For feature work, do NOT work on `main`; use the feature branch or worktree created by Aigon.
- For research work, staying on `main` is normal unless Aigon launched a separate session.
**Recovery**: If you worked in the wrong place, tell the user immediately — do not try to hide it.

### 2. Forgetting lifecycle commands
**Symptom**: Dashboard shows agent as idle when it's actually working, or work is never marked as done.
**Prevention**: Run these in order, every time:
1. `aigon agent-status implementing` — before you start work
2. `aigon agent-status implementation-complete` — after your final commit (or `revision-complete` after addressing review feedback; `research-complete` for research findings)
These are NOT optional. They are mandatory signals.

### 3. Modifying files you don't own (research)
**Symptom**: Research commit includes code changes or other agents' findings.
**Prevention**: In research mode, you write ONLY to `research-{ID}-gg-findings.md`. Stage only that file: `git add docs/specs/research-topics/logs/research-*-gg-findings.md`. Never use `git add .`.

### 4. Using `git add .` or `git add -A`
**Symptom**: Unrelated files (`.env.local`, other agents' work, IDE config) get committed.
**Prevention**: Always stage specific files by path. Run `git status` first to review what changed, then `git add <specific-file>`.

### 5. Running commands you weren't asked to run
**Symptom**: Running `feature-close`, `research-close`, `feature-eval`, or `research-eval` when the user didn't ask.
**Prevention**: After submitting, STAY in the session and wait. The user decides what happens next — close, eval, review, or more changes.

### 6. Not reading the active spec first
**Symptom**: The work doesn't match the actual task, or you pull the wrong CLI context.
**Prevention**: Resolve the matching spec before changing anything:
- Features: `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
- Research: read the spec from `docs/specs/research-topics/03-in-progress/`

### 7. Ignoring the working directory in worktree mode
**Symptom**: Editing files in the main repo instead of the worktree, or vice versa.
**Prevention**: Run `pwd` and verify you're in the correct directory. Aigon-created worktrees and session directories must match the task you are handling.
