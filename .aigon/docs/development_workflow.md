# Development Workflow

This project uses **Aigon**, a spec-driven development workflow for AI agents.

For grouping features into delivery units, read `.aigon/docs/feature-sets.md`.

## Overview

Aigon enforces a structured **Research → Specification → Implementation** loop:

1. **Research Topics** explore the "why" before building
2. **Feature Specs** define the "what" to build

For feature implementation, Aigon can be used in "Solo mode" or "Arena mode".
1. "Solo mode" - use one agent to implement the feature based on the spec to completion.
2. "Arena mode" - use multiple agents to implement a feature in parallel, then evaluate solutions and select a winner.

## Directory Structure

All workflow state lives in `./docs/specs/`. Folders are numbered for visual ordering:

### Customer feedback → research

Customer and user feedback is captured as **research**, not a separate lifecycle. Use `aigon research-create` and set optional frontmatter when the input came from a user or customer:

- `origin: customer-feedback` — distinguishes user voice from agent-initiated investigation
- `reporter` / `source` — who reported it and where it came from (channel, reference, optional url)
- `feedback_refs` — stable refs when migrating legacy `docs/specs/feedback/**` files

Research may recommend zero or more features via its `## Output` section. The old `docs/specs/feedback/` tree and `aigon feedback-*` commands are **legacy**; run `aigon feedback-migrate` (or `aigon doctor --fix`) to convert existing feedback files without duplicating research specs.

### Feature Commands (Unified for Solo and Arena modes)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aigon feature-create <name>` | Create a new feature spec |
| `aigon feature-prioritise <name>` | Assign ID and prioritise to backlog |
| `aigon feature-spec-review <ID>` | Pre-implementation review of the spec itself |
| `aigon feature-start <ID> [agents...]` | Setup for solo (no agents) or arena (with agents) |
| `aigon feature-do <ID> [--iterate]` | Implement feature; `--iterate` runs Autopilot retry loop |
| `aigon feature-status <ID>` | Deep status: session, progress, cost, spec criteria |
| `aigon feature-eval <ID>` | Create evaluation (code review for solo, comparison for arena) |
| `aigon feature-code-review <ID>` | Post-implementation code review with fixes by a different agent |
| `aigon feature-cancel-code-review <ID>` | Cancel an in-progress code review, stop the reviewer session, and return the feature to `ready` |
| `aigon feature-code-revise [ID]` | Implementer-side follow-up after a code review |
| `aigon feature-escalation <accept\|follow-up\|reopen> <ID> <n>` | Disposition an open review escalation before close (`--reason` required; follow-up needs `--name`) |
| `aigon feature-autonomous-stop <ID>` | Stop the AutoConductor and take over manually from the current workflow state |
| `aigon feature-push [ID] [agent]` | Push the feature branch to `origin` for PR review |
| `aigon feature-close <ID> [agent]` | Merge and complete (specify agent in arena mode) |
| `aigon feature-cleanup <ID>` | Clean up arena worktrees and branches |
| `aigon feature-reset <ID>` | Full reset back to backlog (sessions + worktrees + branches + state; stable layout refreshes the lifecycle view) |

## Key Rules

1. **Spec-Driven**: Never write code without resolving the active feature spec via `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
2. **Work in isolation**: Solo mode uses branches, arena mode uses worktrees
3. **Implementation Logs**: Document implementation decisions in `logs/` before completing
4. **Feature lifecycle is engine-backed**: Aigon's workflow engine is the authority for features, and visible spec folders are a projection of that state
5. **Spec creation**: never write spec files directly to `docs/specs/` — always use `aigon feature-create <name>`. Direct writes produce snapshotless specs that appear on the board but cannot be started, tracked, or closed correctly.

## Feature State Model

For features, there are two relevant layers:

- The authoritative lifecycle state lives in `.aigon/workflows/features/{id}/` and is managed by Aigon's workflow engine.
- Under the stable spec layout, the canonical spec file lives in `docs/specs/features/00-specs/` for its whole lifetime.
- The visible stage folders under `docs/specs/features/` are a generated local view of workflow state, not the authority.
- Active feature discovery should use `{{CMD_PREFIX}}feature-list --active` or workflow snapshot reads, not folder probes.

## Review Recovery

When a solo feature is under code review and the current run has gone bad, there are now two explicit recovery tools:

- `aigon feature-autonomous-stop <ID>` stops the AutoConductor and leaves the feature in its current workflow state so you can drive it manually.
- `aigon feature-cancel-code-review <ID>` cancels an in-progress code review, kills the reviewer session, and returns the feature to `ready`.

Typical recovery flow:

1. Stop autonomy if the feature is still under autonomous orchestration.
2. Cancel the bad review.
3. Re-run `aigon feature-code-review <ID>` with a different reviewer or model.

## Review escalations

When a code reviewer finds an issue beyond a safe in-pass fix, they record it in the implementation log under `## Code Review` using:

`ESCALATE:<category> — <reason>`

Categories include at minimum `architectural`, `security`, `scope`, and `spec-shortfall`. List prefixes and bold markers are tolerated.

On `review-complete`, each marker becomes a `review.escalation_raised` workflow event and appears as `openEscalations[]` on the snapshot. By default these are advisory close findings: `aigon feature-close` records the audit signal and keeps moving. Repos that want strict close gates can set `featureClose.integrityPolicy: "blocking"` or add `review-escalation` to `featureClose.blockingGates`.

- `aigon feature-escalation accept <ID> <n> --reason "…"`
- `aigon feature-escalation follow-up <ID> <n> --name <slug>` (creates an inbox follow-up spec)
- `aigon feature-escalation reopen <ID> <n> --reason "…"` (returns to code revision)

Autonomous flows do not auto-accept escalations.

## Implementation logs

Implementation logs are **default-required** for every completed feature. Solo Drive (branch or worktree) needs at least a one-line log in `docs/specs/features/logs/feature-<ID>-*-log.md`; Fleet agents write agent-specific `feature-<ID>-<agent>-*-log.md` files. The only project-wide opt-out is `"logging_level": "never"` in `.aigon/config.json`.

`aigon agent-status implementation-complete` blocks when a required log is missing. `aigon feature-close` surfaces the same gap through the close-integrity framework (`implementation-log` gate — advisory by default, blocking when `featureClose.integrityPolicy` or per-gate overrides select it).

### Backfilling missing logs

Closed features shipped before this policy may lack logs. To backfill manually:

1. Find the feature spec under `docs/specs/features/05-done/` (or the canonical `00-specs/` path in stable layout).
2. Create `docs/specs/features/logs/feature-<ID>-<slug>-log.md` with a one-line **Status** (what shipped and where to look in git).
3. Commit on `main` (or the feature branch if still open).

Known local gaps: **F676** and **F677** (solo-branch closes with no `feature-676-*.md` / `feature-677-*.md` log files). Backfill when touching those areas or before reusing their decisions.

## Solo Mode Workflow

1. Run `aigon feature-start <ID>` to create branch/workflow state and refresh the in-progress view
2. Run `aigon feature-do <ID>` to begin implementation (add `--iterate` for Autopilot retry loop)
3. Read the spec path returned by `aigon feature-spec <ID>`
4. Implement the feature according to the spec
5. Test your changes and wait for user confirmation
6. Commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
7. Update the implementation log in `./docs/specs/features/logs/` (required unless `logging_level: never`)
8. **STOP** - Wait for user to approve before running `aigon feature-close <ID>`

## Per-worktree setup (`worktreeSetup`)

Worktrees are fresh checkouts — they do not share dependency directories, virtualenvs, or any other build artefacts with the main repo. If your agents need those to exist before they start work, declare a setup command in `.aigon/config.json`:

```json
{ "worktreeSetup": "<your repo setup command>" }
```

or (faster, when your stack tolerates it):

```json
{ "worktreeSetup": "<your faster local setup command>" }
```

**When it runs:** after worktree creation configures the agent port, before the agent launches. One execution per worktree.

**Where to set it:** `.aigon/config.json` (project scope). Use `&&` to compose multiple commands on one line.

**Failure semantics:** runs with a 120-second timeout. Failure warns and continues — the agent still launches.

**Anti-pattern:** Aigon does not detect or guess your stack. There is no built-in `pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`/`pip`/`cargo` fallback — if you need per-worktree setup, declare it via `worktreeSetup`.

## Before Completing a Feature

Before running `feature-close`, always:

1. **Push the branch to origin** to save your work remotely:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch-name>
   ```
2. **Ask the user** if they want to delete the local branch after merge (the CLI will delete it by default)

### Post-merge verification gate

After the feature branch merges into your default branch, `feature-close` can run a **post-merge gate** on merged main before marking the feature done. This catches cross-feature interactions that per-worktree checks miss.

Configure in `.aigon/config.json`:

```json
{
  "featureClose": {
    "postMergeGate": "your-verify-command"
  }
}
```

- **String** — shell command run from the repo root on merged main (e.g. your project's verify script).
- **Array** — argv form: `["tool", "arg1", "arg2"]`.
- **`true`** — reuse the deploy command from `commands.deploy` or your package manifest when configured.
- **`false`** — opt out (close prints a loud skip notice).

By default, when the gate fails, the merge is **not** reverted and close continues. Aigon records an advisory audit event, writes the full gate output in `.aigon/state/close-gates/`, and marks the repo-level main branch condition red until a later passing gate clears it.

Repos that want strict close-integrity behavior can opt in:

```json
{
  "featureClose": {
    "integrityPolicy": "blocking",
    "postMergeGate": "your-verify-command"
  }
}
```

Or block only selected policy findings:

```json
{
  "featureClose": {
    "blockingGates": ["post-merge-gate"]
  }
}
```

Supported policy gates are `review-escalation`, `preauth-validation`, `post-merge-gate`, and `implementation-log`. Mechanical failures such as invalid workflow state, missing branches or worktrees, merge conflicts, security scan failures, git failures, and push failures remain hard stops.

The worktree security scan before merge still runs (fail fast before merging). The post-merge gate is the final authority for "done".
