# aigon-feature-do

> **RUN THIS FIRST — no preamble, no --help, no file searches:**
> ```bash
> aigon feature-do $1

Implement a feature. Works in Drive mode (branch), Drive worktree, and Fleet mode (competition).

> **Worktree invariant:** you are already inside the correct repo. If `aigon` fails, read the error — do NOT try to introspect the tool's internals.

## Argument Resolution
If no ID is provided or it doesn't match an active feature, run `aigon feature-list --active`, filter to matches, and ask the user which one.

## Step 1: Attach to the workspace

```bash
aigon feature-do $1
```

Only run `aigon-feature-start $1` if the feature branch/worktree does not exist yet.

## Step 2: Read the spec (already inlined)

The spec body was printed inline by `feature-do` above. **Use that copy.** Do not re-read from disk and do not re-run `aigon feature-spec` — the inline copy is authoritative.

**Skip plan mode — implement directly.**

## Before Step 3: Install dependencies if needed

**Worktrees do not share `node_modules/` with the main repo.** Before running or testing, check if dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
# Check if node_modules exists
test -d node_modules && echo "Dependencies installed" || echo "Need to install dependencies"
```

If missing, install them using the project's package manager:
```bash
# Detect and run the appropriate install command
if [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then pnpm install
elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then yarn install
elif [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then bun install
elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then npm install
elif [ -f "package.json" ]; then npm install
fi
```

## Step 3: Implement

Signal that you are starting (shell command only — do not write `.aigon/state/` files directly):
```bash
aigon agent-status implementing
```

**TIME BUDGET: under 10 minutes.**
- Start coding within 60 seconds. The spec IS your plan.
- Read ONLY files listed in the spec's Technical Approach / Key Files section.
- Do not create test files unless the spec explicitly requires them.
- **COMMIT EARLY AND OFTEN.** After every meaningful change: `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: <what you just did>"`. Never more than 2 minutes of uncommitted work.
- Use **relative paths** from the current worktree. Never absolute paths.
- Run shell commands directly; don't delegate simple commands (test runs, syntax checks, validation batches) to sub-agents.
- **Do not run the project's full / heavy validation suite during ordinary feature work** — that's pre-push territory. Use the project's quick / scoped validation (if any) during iteration. Check the project's own docs (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, etc.) for which commands are which.

**Scope guardrails — read before editing:**
- Do not delete, move, or modify files unrelated to your feature spec. If existing code conflicts with your feature, document it in your log — do not remove it.
- Do not delete any test files. Do not remove existing function exports.
- Do not move spec files between folders — only the CLI manages spec state transitions.
- If you must touch a file outside your feature's area, note it explicitly in your implementation log with the reason.

Work through the acceptance criteria in order.

## Step 4: Commit your implementation

Stage and commit using conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). Verify with `git log --oneline -1`.

**No implementation log (instructions rigor: light).** Proceed directly to **Step 5** (`aigon agent-status implementation-complete`). Do not create `docs/specs/features/logs/feature-{{ARG1_SYNTAX}}-*-log.md`.

## Step 5: Signal completion

After committing, run **immediately**:

```bash
aigon agent-status implementation-complete
```

Hard rules:
- Implementation is **not** complete until this succeeds. Don't say "done" before it exits 0.
- If it fails, diagnose whether it is **scope uncertainty** or an **infrastructure blockage**:
  - **Scope uncertainty** (ambiguous criterion, missing information, decision required): report the error and stop for user guidance. Don't substitute `feature-close` or other commands.
  - **Infrastructure blockage** (pre-existing bug in the submission gate — security scanner, test runner, validation script — that is clearly diagnosable and fixable in ≤10 lines, unrelated to your feature's scope): apply the minimal fix, commit it with message `fix: unblock agent-status gate — <one-line description>`, and retry. Document the fix in your implementation log.
- Ship within 60 seconds of green tests — don't re-run validation "to be sure" or pre-expand the log.

After it succeeds, tell the user: "Implementation complete — ready for review."

**STAY in the session.** If the user requests changes, make them, commit, and say "Changes committed."

Do **not** run `feature-close` or `feature-eval` — that's the user's decision. In Drive mode the recommended next command is `aigon-feature-close <ID>`; in worktree/Fleet modes, wait for the user.
